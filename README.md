# where-in-the-world-frontend
This is a tourism site that renders a map for a city based on user input. We will render a map that shows the city on one page and a form at the bottom of that page where the user can input trip data and save it to their profile.On the profile page, we will display all trip itinerary data for the given user. The user will have the ability to update and delete existing trip data.
